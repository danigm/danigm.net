I'm glad to say that I'll participate again in the [GSoC][2], as
mentor. This year we will continue the work done during the past year,
as part of the [openSUSE][3] project.

So this summer I'll be mentoring an intern and we'll continue working
on improving the testing framework of the [rpmlint project][1].

This year we've a better testing framework, thanks to the work done
during the past Summer of Code, by Afrid. So the goal for this year is
to try to modernize existing tests and remove as much files as
possible from `test/binary` directory, replacing those with mock
packages defined with python code.

The selected intern is [Luz Marina Montilla Marín][5]. She has done
some initial work in the rpmlint project, creating the mock packages
for some tests and we've just started with the work to do during the
GSoC program, evaluating the tests that we've right now and planning
were to start.

She studies at Córdoba, Spain, my hometown. Every year I try to reach
young people at different local universities, here in Andalucía, and
sometimes I'm able to convince some students to participate, like the
[GSoC 2020][6], when Alejandro Dominguez, from Seville, were working
on Fractal. So I'm happy that I'm increasing the number of free
software developers in my local community :D

I'm sure that she will be able to achieve great things during these
three months, so I'm looking forward to start to code and see how far
can we go.
