## The event

[The Linux App Summit][1] (LAS) is a great event that bring together a lot of
linux application developers, from the bigger communities, it's organized by
GNOME and KDE in collaboration and it's a good place to talk about the Linux
desktop, application distribution and development.

This year the event was organized in Barcelona, this is not too far from my
home town, MÃ¡laga, so I want to be there.

I sent a talk proposal and was accepted, so I was talking about distributing
services with flatpak and problems related to service deployment in a flatpaked
world.

Clicking in this image you can find my talk in the event streaming. The sound
is not too good and my accent doesn't help, but there it is :D

The event was a really great event, with really good talks, about different
topics, we've some technical talks, some talks about design, talks about
language, about distribution, about the market and economics, and at least two
about "removing" the system tray ðŸ˜‹

It was really interesting the talk about the ["future" inclusion of payments][2] in
flathub because I think that this will give a new incentive to people to write
and publish apps in flathub and could be a great step to get donations for
developers.

Another talk that I liked was the one about the [maintenance of flatpak repositories][3],
it's always interesting to know how the things works and this talk give an easy
introduction to ostree, flatpak, repositories and application distribution.

Besides the talks, this event is really interesting for the people that bring
together. I've been talking with a lot of people, not too much, because I'm a
shy person, but I've the opportunity to talk a bit with some Fractal
developers, and during a coffee talk with Jordan Petridis, we've time to share
some ideas about a cool new functionality that maybe we can implement in the
near future, thanks to the outreachy program and maybe some help from the
gstreamer people.

I'm also very happy to be able to spend some time talking with MartÃ­n Abente,
about sugar labs, the hack computer and the different ways to teach kids with
free software. MartÃ­n is a really nice person and I liked a lot to meet him and
share some thoughts.

## The city

This is not my first time in Barcelona, I was here at the beginning of this
year, but this is a great city and I've no time to visit all the places the
first time.

So I've spent the Thursday afternoon doing some tourism, visiting the "Sagrada
Familia" and the "MontjuÃ¯c" fountain.

If you have not been in Barcelona and you have the opportunity to come here,
don't hesitate, it's a really good city, with a great architecture to admire
and really nice culture and people, and here you can find good food to enjoy.
