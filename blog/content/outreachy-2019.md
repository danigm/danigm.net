## The Outreachy Program

The [Outreachy][1] program provides internship to work in Free and Open Source
Software. This year I've proposed two projects as part of the GNOME project and
we've two interns working for three months, so we'll have a lot of improvements
in the following months!

I'll be mentoring these interns, so I will need to spend some time helping them
to work on the existing codebase, but it worth it, if this makes more people to
collaborate in free software development and if this help us to improve some
useful apps.

These two projects are Fractal and the GNOME translation editor. You can take a
look to the list of [outreachy interns][6].

## Fractal

Fractal is a Matrix.org gtk client, and I've proposed for this year program to
[implement a video player in the message list][2]. We've a preview for images,
for audio files but nothing for video files.

[Sonja Heinze][4] is the one that will be working on this during the next three
months. She has been working during the past month in some small issues in
Fractal so I'm really sure that she will be able to do great contributions to
the project.

Jordan Petridis (alatiera) will be helping in this project as a co-mentor, I
don't know a lot about gstreamer, so he'll be really helpful here with the
gstreamer and rust.

## GNOME translation editor (Gtranslator)

GNOME translation editor (gtranslator) is a simple .po editor. I've proposed to
[Rework the search and replace dialog][3]. We've right now a simple
find/replace modal dialog and I want to modernize the interface to integrate
better in the window as a popover.

[Priyanka Saggu][5] is the one that will be working on this during the next
three months. She has been working on gtranslator during the past month and she
has done great contributions and improvements during this time.

Daniel Mustieles is the other co-mentor for this project. He's an experienced
GNOME translator so he will help us a lot with the app user experience design
and testing.
