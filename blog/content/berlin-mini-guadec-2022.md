## The GUADEC is back!

This year, the famous GNOME developers meeting event, the [GUADEC][1], gets
back to "normal" after the last year global COVID-19 situation. And when I say
normal, I'm talking about people meeting in one place to share knowledge and to
build a great community around this great software project.

This year the even was in Guadalajara, Mexico, and that's great, but a bit far
to go from Spain... But thankfully, some of GNOME folks who can't go to Mexico
organized a parallel event to attend remotely in Berlin, Europe, that's the
Berlin Mini GUADEC.

I decided to join this people, because there's a direct flight from MÃ¡laga, so
it was not a very long travel for me. This was my first big trip after COVID, and
I was a bit afraid, but besides the heat wave, everything was great.

## My talk

The GUADEC event allows a remote attendance and also remote participation, so I
proposed [a talk][2] that I finally did from Berlin thanks to the [c-base][4]
people that build a great setup to give the talk to the local people at the
same time that it was streamed to the main event in Mexico.

As you may know, I started to do [live coding streaming][5] this year, and
there are also other [GNOME Developers][6] doing that, so I wanted to talk
about this new way of sharing and build community, and that was my talk about.

You can watch my full talk in Youtube:

## Endless

It's not all party and fun in this event, there's also time to work. We take
advantage of this event and some of the Endless people take the opportunity to
meet together.

</p>

We're fully remote and I started to work at Endless in 2019. We had the
opportunity to meet one time in London, but after that, this is the second time
we had the opportunity to share some time together and it was great. Besides
the day to day work, that can be done in remote completely, it's always nice to
have the opportunity to share some time with coworkers to meet the real person.

## Thanks

My travel was sponsored by the [GNOME Foundation][3], and thanks to the
[EndlessOS Foundation][7], to give me the opportunity to be part of this great
community.
