Is the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, so it's the right time to look
back and see what great things happened during the year, and also it's the time
to plan some new year resolutions.

## My contribution to GNOME in 2022

I've been focused this year on the [GNOME Translation Editor][2], migrating it
to Gtk4. It's not ready yet, but I hope I will be able to have a working
version soonâ„¢.

It started this summer with one intern from [Outreachy][1], that did some
initial work, building with the new Gtk4, and after the summer I started to
clean the code and fixing issues, and lately, I'm trying to replace some
deprecations for the next Gtk release.

so I'm working on the code, modernizing it, and replacing every usage of
`GtkDialog` and `GtkTreeView`, and trying to follow the [GNOME HIG][3] as much
as possible.

### Live coding Streaming

I started the year spending a lot of time working on Gtk on live stream on
[Twitch][4], but after the summer I was spending less time... I didn't find the
time or the energy to do it regularly.

## Changes in the business

This year was also a year of changes in my work life. After the summer I left
Endless, after three years of working there, to join SUSE.

I really enjoy my time at [EndlessOS][5], the first years working on the Hack
Computer and the last year working on the Endless Key. I really like the
EndlessOS mission and what I was doing there, with a lot of great people.

But I was looking for something more in my career path, and I had the
opportunity to join SUSE. Since September, I'm part of the Python packaging
team at SUSE and I've to say that I really love this job. It's a bit different
from what I have been doing before, but the maintainer life is something that I
enjoy, having the opportunity to contribute to a lot of different projects and
debugging and fixing random bugs is one of the most rewarding tasks to do (when
you are able to find the problem).

Tumbleweed is now my favourite GNU/Linux distribution and the future of
[SUSE ALP][6] looks really promising.

## Changes in life

This year comes also with a lot of changes in my personal life too! At the
beginning of the year I was able to bought a house, so I've now a permanent
residency, after a lot of years of changing from one rent house to another one.

And this year was also the year that I was able to get the kickboxing black
belt, after almost 8 years of practicing. This is the end of a learning path,
and also the beginning of a different one, trying to master this fighting
sport.

## New year resolutions

2022 was great, but we can make 2023 even better, I'm looking always to learn
and improve, so it's good to do some new year resolutions to try to complete
during the next year.

 * Complete the Gtranslator migration to gtk4 and GNOME HIG improvements!
 * Be more regular with the live coding streams
 * Give some love to the [PyGObject][7] project
 * Do more serious kickboxing training and loose 10Kg
 * Play more chess games

That's all! Happy new year and Have a lot of fun...
