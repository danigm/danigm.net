I'm glad to say that I'll participate again in the [GSoC][2], as
mentor. This year will be a bit different from the previous ones,
because I'm not mentoring a GNOME project but a [openSUSE][3] project.

I started to work at SUSE the past year and with this new job I get
involved in the openSUSE community and I started to contribute to
[rpmlint][4].

So this summer I'll be mentoring an intern and we'll work on improving
the testing framework of the [rpmlint project][1].

The rpmlint project is a command line tool to check rpm packages, the
correctness of these kind of packages and warn the packagers about
usual problems or good practices. It's widely used in all Linux
distributions based on rpm, mainly SUSE and RedHat.

It is written in Python and uses pytest for testing the code. Right
now there are a lot of .rpm binary packages, to check different
functionality, but that way of testing makes a bit hard to write new
tests and to maintain with changes. The idea of this GSoC project is
to extend the testing framework of rpmlint to support an easy way
of writting tests that doesn't require a real rpm, something that can
mock what it's in the .rpm binary and try to replace some of the
current binary tests with this new mock.

The selected student is Afrid Hussain. He has done some initial work
in the rpmlint project, solving some minor issues and we're now
preparing the work to be done during the GSoC program. I'm sure that
he will be able to achieve great things during this three months, so
I'm looking forward to start to code and see how far we can go.
